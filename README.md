# integration-cookbook

[![CI](https://github.com/chinmaya-chhatre/integration-cookbook/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/chinmaya-chhatre/integration-cookbook/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Runnable, tested integration recipes for the problems customers actually bring to a Solutions
Engineer: "our webhook never arrives", "events show up twice", "the target was down for an
hour, what did we lose?". Each recipe is a small, complete integration with tests for the ways
it breaks, and the checklists and documents you would hand over with it.

The recipes run on [HookScope](https://github.com/chinmaya-chhatre/Coding_repo), a webhook
receiver that verifies signatures, retries deliveries and lets you replay events.

> **Status: just started.** The plan, with a date schedule and one checklist item per commit,
> is in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). The table below is what is planned, not what exists yet;
> a recipe's row gets a link when its folder lands.
>
> What exists so far: [`common/`](common), signed-request builders and ready-made example events
> for GitHub, Stripe, Shopify, Slack, Twilio, Svix and generic HMAC senders, checked against the
> providers' published test vectors, and `common/mocks/`, Jira-, CRM- and warehouse-style mock
> servers that can be told to answer 500, 429 or slowly.
>
> Finished recipes: [stripe-invoice-paid-to-slack](recipes/stripe-invoice-paid-to-slack) and [github-pr-to-jira](recipes/github-pr-to-jira): all seven parts each, with end-to-end tests that run HookScope in-process.
>
> Try it: `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`, then `make test` (or `make test RECIPE=<name>`), `make check` for
> lint plus tests (what CI runs: lint, Markdown link and diagram checks, tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12, the compose files, and one job per recipe), and `make up` to start HookScope with Docker (`make help` lists everything).

## Who it is for

- **Solutions and integration engineers** designing or debugging a customer integration, who
  want a working starting point and an honest list of what goes wrong.
- **Customer developers** who would rather read a tested example than a vendor's one-page guide.

## Recipes (planned)

| # | Recipe | The problem it solves |
|---|---|---|
| R1 | [**stripe-invoice-paid-to-slack**](recipes/stripe-invoice-paid-to-slack) | Tell finance about paid invoices above a threshold, in a readable message |
| R2 | [**github-pr-to-jira**](recipes/github-pr-to-jira) | Create and transition Jira issues from pull request events, once per PR |
| R3 | [**shopify-order-to-warehouse**](recipes/shopify-order-to-warehouse) *(in progress)* | Reshape orders into a warehouse schema; survive an outage and replay afterwards |
| R4 | **stripe-subscription-lifecycle-to-crm** | Keep a CRM correct when subscription events arrive out of order or twice |
| R5 | **twilio-sms-to-support-ticket** | Turn inbound SMS into tickets, including the proxy and URL signature pitfall |
| R6 | **webhook-to-queue-on-aws** | Acknowledge fast, process later: HookScope, SQS and a worker, with Terraform |
| R7 | **slack-slash-command-bot** | Respect Slack's three-second rule with delayed responses |
| R8 | **customer-rest-api-client** | OAuth2 client credentials, pagination, 429 backoff and idempotency keys |
| R9 | **bulk-csv-import** | Load large files with a partial-failure report and resumable runs |
| R10 | **trace-an-integration** | Follow one event end to end with correlation ids, a dashboard and a runbook |

## What every recipe contains

Each lives in `recipes/<name>/` and is finished only when it has all seven parts:

1. **Problem and architecture**: the scenario, with architecture and sequence diagrams
2. **Config**: the HookScope rules and a `docker-compose.yml` that runs the whole thing
3. **Core code**: the handler or transform, in small typed functions
4. **Happy-path tests**: realistic, signed provider payloads
5. **Failure-mode tests**: retries, duplicates, out-of-order events, a target returning 429 or 500, replay after an outage
6. **Troubleshooting**: symptom, likely cause, how to check, how to fix, with real log and metric examples
7. **Customer pack**: FAQ, discovery questions and a go-live checklist for that integration

## Solutions Engineer documents (planned)

Integration design checklist, discovery question bank, proof-of-concept plan and success
criteria, go-live checklist, a troubleshooting decision tree, answers to common security
questionnaire questions, a sizing and rate-limit worksheet, and a guide to choosing between
push, pull and batch.

## Ground rules

- Mock servers stand in for Jira, a CRM and a warehouse, and the recipes say so. Nothing here
  claims a vendor certification or has been run against a vendor's production system.
- Anything that needs real cloud credentials is validated (`terraform validate`, LocalStack),
  never applied.
- A recipe ships with its failure-mode tests or it does not ship.
