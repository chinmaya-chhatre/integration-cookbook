# Contributing

This repository is a set of integration recipes, each one a small, complete, tested example of a
problem customers bring to a Solutions Engineer, plus the documents that go with them. This page
says how to set up, how to add a recipe and what "finished" means. The plan and schedule are in
[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).

## Set up

You need Python 3.11 or newer. Docker is only needed to run a recipe's stack (`make up`).

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
make help      # every target
make check     # what CI runs: lint, docs checks, tests
```

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `make test` | All tests; `make test RECIPE=<name>` runs one recipe's |
| `make lint` | `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` |
| `make format` | Apply the formatting |
| `make docs` | Check Markdown links and Mermaid diagrams |
| `make up RECIPE=<name>` | Start HookScope and the recipe's own services; `make down` stops them |

## Add a recipe

1. Copy [`recipes/_template/`](recipes/_template/README.md) to `recipes/<name>/`. The name says what
   goes in and what comes out, like `stripe-invoice-paid-to-slack`.
2. Add an empty `recipes/<name>/.wip` file. Fill in the README section by section, as you build each part. The skeleton has one section per
   part of the definition of done below.
3. Build on what is already here instead of rewriting it:
   - [`common/fixtures.py`](common/fixtures.py) and [`common/signing.py`](common/signing.py) give you
     correctly signed requests for each provider, so tests post realistic payloads.
   - [`common/mocks/`](common/mocks) are Jira-, CRM- and warehouse-style servers that can be told to
     answer 500, 429 or slowly. Use them as the target of your recipe.
   - [`docker-compose.base.yml`](docker-compose.base.yml) runs HookScope. Your recipe's own
     `docker-compose.yml` adds its services and talks to `http://hookscope:8000`; point
     `HOOKSCOPE_RULES_FILE` at your `rules.json`.
4. Run `make test RECIPE=<name>` and `make check` before you push.

## A recipe is done when it has all seven parts

Each part is one commit, in this order, so the history reads as the story of building it.

1. **Problem and architecture**: the scenario in the customer's words, with a Mermaid architecture
   diagram and a sequence diagram.
2. **Config**: the HookScope rules and a `docker-compose.yml` that runs the whole recipe with
   `make up RECIPE=<name>`.
3. **Core code**: the handler or transform, in small typed functions.
4. **Happy-path tests**: realistic, signed payloads from `common/`, not hand-written headers.
5. **Failure-mode tests**: at least retries, duplicates, out-of-order events where they apply, the
   target answering 429 and 500, and replay after an outage. This is what makes a recipe useful to a
   customer; a recipe does not ship without it.
6. **Troubleshooting**: symptom, likely cause, how to check it, how to fix it, with real log lines
   and metric names, not placeholders.
7. **Customer pack**: a FAQ, discovery questions and a go-live checklist for this integration.

CI runs one job per finished recipe and fails a recipe that has no tests. While you are still building
yours, keep an empty `.wip` file in its folder so CI leaves it out; the commit that adds the last part
deletes the file, and the recipe joins the matrix.

## Ground rules

- **Be honest about what is simulated.** The mock servers stand in for Jira, a CRM and a warehouse.
  Say so, and never claim a vendor certification or that a recipe was run against a vendor's
  production system.
- **Check provider behaviour against the provider's own documentation or test vectors**, and link to
  them, rather than from memory.
- **No real credentials, ever.** Secrets in the repo are public demo values from
  `common/fixtures.py`. Anything that needs real cloud credentials is validated (`terraform validate`,
  LocalStack), never applied.
- **Tests do not get weakened to pass.** If a test is wrong, fix the test and say why in the commit.
- **One focused change per commit**, with its tests, and a message that says what and why.

## Documents and diagrams

Markdown is checked in CI: every relative link and `#anchor` has to resolve, and every `mermaid`
block needs a known diagram type, balanced brackets and quotes and matched `subgraph`/`end` pairs.
Run `make docs` to see the same result locally. The check catches typos that would break rendering;
it is not a full Mermaid parser, so look at the diagram on GitHub too.
